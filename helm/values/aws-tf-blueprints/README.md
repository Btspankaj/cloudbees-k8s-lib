# aws-tf-blueprints

These helm values files are prepared for being integrated with the AWS Terraform Blueprints.

They can be merged with other existing values including in the add-on definition like this example for [kube-prometheus-stack](https://github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-eks-blueprints/blob/v4.25.0/modules/kubernetes-addons/kube-prometheus-stack/values.yaml)
